The series starts off with a scary coup during planet Akiridion-5's coronation ceremony, leaving king-in-waiting Krel (Diego Luna, Narcos) and queen-in-waiting Aja (Tatiana Maslany, Orphan Black) no choice but to flee to Earth with their bodyguard Varvatos Vex (Nick Offerman, Parks and Recreation). Their spaceship is damaged in the journey, but its AI controller Mother (Glenn Close), is still able to turn cyborgs Aja, Krel, and Varvatos into human disguises, their spaceship into a mid-century modern house, and spare robots into 1950s caricatures of perfect White suburban parents. Aja and Krel do their best to blend into regular high school life while trying to find parts to repair the spaceship, which also may bring their murdered parents back to life. All the while, they're being pursued by the bad guy from back home, General Morando, and his robot henchmen. Can they fix their spaceship, save their parents, and get back home, before their human friends figure out who they really are?",,3Below: Tales of Arcadia,,"['Tatiana Maslany', 'Frank Welker', 'Cheryl Hines', 'Glenn Close', 'Diego Luna', 'Nick Offerman', 'Nick Frost']",75,,2018.0,2019.0,['Guillermo del Toro'],2.0,26.0,action,adventure,animation
