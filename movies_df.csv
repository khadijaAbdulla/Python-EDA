This is Peter, Paul and Mary at the peak of their artistry, a time when this popular and influential trio dominated the Billboard music charts. From the group's emergence in Greenwich Village, the hub of the Folk Music scene in New York, to the Civil Rights and Anti-War era of the 1960s, through the decades of their later advocacy and music, to Mary Travers' moving memorial, and finally to the present, where their legacy continues to inform and inspire successive generations, this far deeper and more intimate exploration of the trio reveals the impact of their artistry and activism on their generation and the world. We wanted to sing songs of substance. We always felt that our actions had to have worth to be worth doing. We wanted to work together enough to have it be a meaningful part of our lives, but not so much that it wouldn't be fun. 50 YEARS WITH PETER, PAUL AND MARY features these songs and more: •""Leaving On A Jet Plane"" •""Blowin' In The Wind"" •""Puff, the Magic Dragon"" •""Five Hundred Miles"" •""Brother, Can You Spare A Dime?"" •""If I Had My Way"" •""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" •"" There But For Fortune •""Early Mornin' Rain"" •""Where Have All the Flowers Gone?""",2014,50 Years with Peter Paul and Mary,[],"['Mary Travers', 'Peter Yarrow', 'Paul Stookey']",52,77.0,documentary,,
